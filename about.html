          <h1>Sophomore in the Global Business Honors Program at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Global Business with concentration in Global Finance and Business Economics and a minor in Mathematics. Naturally possessing an entrepreneurial mindset, having experience co-founding and working in the financial management of non-profit organizations, most notably NYC Says Enough and Gays Against Guns, starting from high school sophomore year, and, more recently, completion of a year-long fellowship program by Social Impact 360. Infused with exceptional history with political engagement, which include experience organizing a student rally attended by a US Senator, strategizing voter outreach plans for local Democratic candidates in Lower Manhattan, and collaborating with community activists and progressive special interest groups for the purpose of building political coalitions, and internship experience at political appointment offices, including Kings County District Attorney’s Office and NYS Division of Human Rights, I bring a truly unique perspective in all things related to business––my passion.
              You can always find me at the Marshall Chess Club or Astoria Park in NYC. But you can also reach me at: akibria@fordham.edu</h1>
